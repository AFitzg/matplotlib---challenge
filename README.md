Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots
Goal is to plot data through various graphs to get visual confirmation of whether certain drug regimens are helping decrease tumor volume in mice tests.
Graphs to produce are line and scatter plots, box plots, and pie plots. 
Using summary statistics to calculate the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM.
Lastly, using all of the graphs and plots, be able to produce observations on the data.


#Observations
#1. Tumor Volume and Mouse weight related - can tell this from the correlation being close to 1 and the data having a positive linear regression value.
#2. The only outlier in the data appeared to be for for infubinol, which impacts the mean and can skew the data in the dataset.
#3. Capomulin and Ramicane presented similar summary statistics, line plosts, catter plots, and box plots. I went back and did line plots for Ramicane and Infubiunol to look at connections. The line plots for Ramicane and Capomulin are very close. Ramicane would be another treatment to check out in reducing tumor volumn just like Capomulin due to the data.
